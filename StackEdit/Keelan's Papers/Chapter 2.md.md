In the year 1883, Emma Lazarus penned words that would mark an American generation. Truly they would set in bronze an American ideal. The words: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” and along with the rest of the sonnet, they stand today erected on the base of the statue for which they were written.(Lazarus, New Colossus.) To the contemporary American, the Statue of Liberty stands as a symbol of our freedom. Her origin, however, testifies to a specific kind of liberty, namely that granted to the masses of immigrants following hope to the new world. Placed in New York harbor June 19, 1885, the statue welcomed millions of newcomers. In fact, the 35 years that followed the placement of the statue saw the largest mass migration of peoples in United States history until the present era. Latourette wrote, “Here was a movement of peoples which for magnitude was unapproached in the nineteenth century. It has seldom if ever been equalled in the entire history of mankind.”^[Latourette1941-fx, 224.] Not until recent years has immigration reached a remotely comparable level to the period between 1880 and 1920. America's industrialization and subsequent urbanization coalesced with this first great wave of immigration to create her towering cities and strong commerce. In many ways, today's United States were forged during this era of rapid American growth.
