## Introduction
Eschatology births missiology. Certainly Kahler's statement, as quoted by Bosch, rings true that mission is the mother of theology. However, even Bosch continues by citing Kasemann's claim that apocalyptic serves as the headwaters of theology in the New Testament. Bosch concludes these two ideas–mission and apocalyptic–are complementary. (Bosch, Transforming Mission, 2 and Endnote 1) Eschatology and missiology stand in unique relationship one to another. One's eschatology provides shape and direction to missions, while one's missiology provides response to convictions concerning the ultimate telos of creation. Walls rightly summarizes this connection, stating, "Eschatology is where theology meets history most intimately, since it is concerned with history’s end and meaning." (Walls, Eschatology and the Western Missionary Movement, 182.)
 
An eschatological thread can be traced throughout the entire modern missions movements. Stanely writes, "From the genesis of the evangelical Protestant missionary movement in the mid-eighteenth century supporters of Christian missions had drawn from their Bibles the belief that it was the sovereign purpose of God to bring all humanity to the point of submission to the lordship of Jesus Christ."
Stanely, Future in the Past, 102-103
This belief in the sovereign purpose of Protestant missions fueled a great deal of missionary endeavors and created the sending engine of Western missions. Stanely continues, "The goal of the Protestant missionary enterprise as understood by its founders was, then, an eschatological one: it was nothing less than the realisation [sic] of the biblical vision of a world transformed by being filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea."
Stanely, Future in the Past, 103
Furthermore, it provided structure and substance to the specific tactics of missionary engagement. One's understanding of their missionary activity rested upon their hope for what it would accomplish. In this way, certain aspects of one's eschatology determined the activities they classified as missions and the manner in which these activities would be executed. Key doctrines, such as millennial views and one's understanding of the kingdom of God, became bell weathers for particular missionary hopes and methods.
 
During certain eras in missions history, the eschatological thread becomes clearly visible as grounding for missionary activity. The Gilded Age and early Progressive Era in American history is one such time. Key doctrines, such as millennial views and one's understanding of the kingdom of God, became bell weathers for particular missionary hopes and methods by Protestant Americans. While this connection has been noted before concerning international mission efforts by American Protestants, the influence on home missions was no less significant, especially concerning cross-cultural missions toward the burgeoning immigrant populations of the era.
Rogers, A Bright New Constellation, traces the impact of millennial narratives on the development of American Protestant foreign missions.
Though not the exclusive factor, Protestant majority views on the millennium and the kingdom of God significantly influenced applied home missionary methods toward immigrants from 1880-1920, resulting in a syncretized mission to Christianize and Americanize the immigrant.
 
By the turn of the twentieth century, postmillennialism was the dominant eschatological position concerning the millennium. Furthermore, the millennial expectation was increasingly tied to human initiative and the ideal of progress. Moorhead writes, "Although the union of progress with the symbols of the Apocalypse may strike the contemporary reader as awkward or quaint, its widespread popularity suggests that postmillennialism-with all its antinomies-must be taken seriously if one wishes to understand the world as it appeared to many persons only a few generations ago."
Moorhead, Between Progress, 525-526.
For the overwhelming majority of Protestants during the era, America civilization was conflated with the coming kingdom of God. Therefore, home missions to immigrants was cast as a dual mission to Christianize and Americanize those coming from abroad. For some Protestants, these new immigrants from different cultures were seen as a threat to the developing American civilization, which made them a threat for Protestants laboring to build the kingdom of God. For others, the arrival of these immigrants was an opportunity to showcase the superiority of Christian and American civilization, as it converted them to both. Regardless, both conflated the Christian mission with the cultural mission of American assimilation.
 
This paper will first consider the development of the dominant Protestant understanding of the millennium by tracing its origins, outlining its growth and entrenchment in the American Protestant conscience, and demonstrating its significance at the turn of the twentieth century. If American Protestants eschatological presuppositions grounded a mission of optimistically building the coming kingdom, then the content of that kingdom ideal comes to the fore in any applied theology. This paper will subsequently examine certain theologies of the kingdom, especially those influenced by Alrbecht Ritschl, and their role in crafting missionary missionary methods. Finally, the paper will survey missionary methods toward immigrants during the Gilded Age and early Progressive Era to showcase their reliance on Protestant eschatological commitments.
