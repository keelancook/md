## Introduction
I want to start today with a question: **What drives you as a person? **What is that core thing that fuels your life? That guides your decisions about work and family, where you will live, how you will spend your time, who you talk to. Underneath all the other reasons, there is something, buried deep inside.

Last week, Russell began our series on values. Of course, everyone has values, right? Values are those core convictions that motivate how you think and what you do. Everyone has them, but everyone’s values are not the same. As a church, our leadership has worked hard to set our values right from the pages of Scripture. Our hope is that those things that Christ held most significant are, in fact, the things we hold most significant. After all, your values are the answer to the question I just asked: What drives you as a person?

Last week, Russell discussed the value of new relationships, of intentionally patterning our lives in such a way that we are constantly making new relationships with those outside of the faith. God wants all people to have the opportunity to hear the good news of peace found only in Christ. Russell showed us how this idea was close to the heart of Jesus.

Today, I want to introduce another of our core values: **global impact**.

At the very center of the Bible’s message is the firm promise that God is going to change the whole world, and that Christ’s church plays a key role in that mission. Jesus has, in fact, commanded the church to have a global impact. Two thousand years ago, right after Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection, he told his church specifically what kind of work they were to be doing, and it was no less than a global mission. We refer to it today as the Great Commission. And that small band of just over 100 people took Christ’s command and promise and sparked the largest movement in the history of the world. But hear this:_ that mission of global impact is no less pressing for us as a local church today than it was for that small band of believers after the resurrection._

David Platt says it this way: 
>Global mission is the purpose of your life. Everything you have been given in your life – your breath, your salvation, your family, your gifts, your resources, your position – everything you have, you’ve been given for this reason: the spread of God’s global glory.

The Great Commission is perhaps the most important directive in the mission of the church. In fact, the whole reason the church exists can be summed up in these words. 

So as we talk about our value of global impact, this is what I want you to get today: 

**_Jesus calls, equips, empowers, and sends his Church on an all-encompassing mission with a global impact, for the good of the nations and the demonstration of his glory._**

Let’s take a closer look at this mission, and see just how, all-encompassing it is, so that we can be about doing what we’ve been gathered to do.

## The Passage
> And Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age (Matthew 28:18-20).


### Final words are important words.
If we want to get a sense of just how important this passage is in the life of the church, we can see that from its context in the book of Matthew. Most good commentaries on Matthew point out that the entire outline of the book leads up to this moment when Jesus delivers his commission, a crescendo at the very end, where Jesus tells his church what they are supposed to do. These are the very last words that Jesus says to his new church before he goes to heaven. Think about the importance of that for a minute. Someone’s last words (if they get to choose them) are important words. Jesus knows what is fixin to happen, and this is what he chooses to tell them.

And what he delivers is remarkable. He gives the church its marching orders until he returns. The commission can really be discussed in two main categories: (1) what the church is supposed to do and (2) the details about how this will go down. _What we see is a specific mission with a global impact._

And that’s the way I want us to talk about it today. First, what is our commision? And second, just how big is our commission?

## So what is our commission?
Simply put, our task is to make disciples. 

In Genesis, God told Adam and Eve, the first disciples, to be fruitful and multiply. They were to fill the earth with people, but before the fall, filling the earth with people meant filling it with disciples… with followers… with worshippers. 

But after the fall, when sin entered the world through humanity’s own rebellion, everything changed. Adam and Eve did fill the world, but it wasn’t with worshippers. It was with sinners, people the Bible says are separated from God, rebels to his will. The Bible even calls them enemies of God. 

But like God’s command to Adam and Eve in the garden, Christ commissions his newly formed church to fill the world with disciples. And that is precisely what we are supposed to do. That is our concern, and that should be our chief ambition in life, to spread the good news of Christ’s salvation in order to make unbelievers into disciples. _If you’re a Christian,_ _as one who has already experienced this grace, this new life, this new relationship with God himself, as one who has tasted of the goodness of the gospel, this should be **your** chief ambition in life, to spread the good news of Christ’s salvation in order to make unbelievers into disciples._

But now that raises a question, doesn’t it… **have you ever made a disciple?** 

If so, how long’s it been?

Now you may be thinking that you have no idea what that even looks like. Realize, making disciples means talking to lost people. This is exactly why Russell underscored new relationships so much last week. Developing new relationships with those outside the faith stands at the very center of our mission. It is about face to face relationships that include sharing the gospel. There’s just no way around that.

And I agree with what Russell said last week. We weaken the definition of discipleship when we divorce it from evangelism. A lot of times, _we think making disciples is taking people who already believe what we believe and helping them believe it better_. Think of what most churches call discipleship ministries. They’re all studies for their own church members… or it’s organic discipleship, which means sitting in a coffeeshop with another believer and talking about some Christian book. 

I’m not saying that stuff is bad… But I am saying that is not exactly what the Great Commission is talking about when it uses the phrase make disciples. In the context of this passage, think of _making disciples_ as making _new_ disciples. Your mission of making new disciples begins with people who have not yet crossed the line into faith. It starts with people you work with, it starts with the people that go to that new hindu temple in town, it starts with your neighbors that haven’t been to church in 11 years. It starts when we think even broader than that and realize there are multitudes out there in closed countries around the world with no way of even hearing the gospel… and that some of us… some of _you_ need to take it to them.

Jesus can’t be more clear: my job, your job, as part of a local church, is sharing the gospel with people who don’t yet believe so that the Holy Spirit takes some of these people and changes them from unbelievers into disciples. Then we walk with these people from unbelief all the way to spiritual maturity, as they begin making new disciples. That is a task for every member of this church. **_The only way we can have the global impact Christ promises is by doing the mission that Christ commands. _**

So, there’s the what of the commission: making new disciples. Now that we’ve considered that, let’s take a look at just how big this mission really is.

## How big is our commission?
After setting out a specific mission, Jesus spends most of the commission describing its scope. And let me tell you, it’s big. It’s real big. 

Back in the first century when Matthew wrote this gospel, repeating adjectives in the same passage was a common way of emphasize their meaning. For instance: today we say big and if we want to describe something as even larger, we say very big. In Greek back then, it would be common to say big twice in the same sentence, kinda like big big. It’s called stacking modifiers. The only reason I point that out is because Matthew does that here. Except he doesn’t use the adjective twice… he uses it four times. Four separate times in one command, Jesus says the word **_all_** to describe the scope of this mission. It is not just all-encompassing, it is all, all, all, all-encompassing. 

In other words, it is life-consuming. This mission is an identity-changing mission. It is all-encompassing for the agent. The agent of mission is the one that does the mission. That’s the church. If you’re a believer in Christ, that’s you and me. We are the agent’s of the church’s mission. So, it is a life-consuming mission for the agent. 

And it has nothing less than global impact as its object. There is no person on earth outside the scope of this mission. And here’s the beautiful part. The goal of Christ’s commission is the make the objects of mission into new agents of mission. 

Now let’s take a look a look at those “alls”...

### This mission has “All Authority”
Jesus begins his commission to the church talking about his authority. Notice that this first **all** statement has nothing to do with us and everything to do with him. Before Jesus delivers the specifics he wants to set one thing straight, this mission is accomplished by his power and authority. Authority serves as a central theme in Matthew's gospel. After the sermon on the mount, the crowds were astounded by the authority with which Jesus spoke (Matt. 5-7). That authority comes up repeatedly throughout the gospel, and here, Jesus references his own authority directly, noting that it is granted him by his Heavenly Father. We cannot underestimate the significance of this authority.

See, having Jesus’s authority means having all the authority. There is no higher source of authority. Jesus knows when it comes to an all-encompassing mission with a global impact, this is precisely the kind of authority we need to have complete confidence in whatever statements follow this one. These words of authority should be a great comfort to the disciples. After all, if God is for us… who can be against us? 

You know, that matters for us today too. Pressure against the message of the Christian gospel is mounting here and overseas. Public opinion here in the States is no longer on our side. Being a faithful disciple no longer means fitting into society. Now, it means sticking out and disagreeing with the common opinions on a lot of things. And let’s be honest, there is a real cultural pressure against telling someone there is only one way to find real peace and purpose. To claiming, with the Scriptures, that there is only one name given under heaven by which we can be saved. And folks, the pressure exerted on us by cultural authorities is nothing compared to the governmental and religious persecution suffered by so many Christians overseas. There are places all over the world where simply identifying as a Christian comes with a potential death sentence, let alone proclaiming the gospel message.  But regardless of whatever authorities attempt to mount against this mission, whether it is the court of public opinion or the actual courts of a government, Christ declares he has all authority in Heaven and Earth. In the battle for creation, we are on the winning side!  

And so we go out in confidence.


### This mission is to “All nations”
When Christ says "all nations" that means no one is left out of our disciple-making mission. There is no room for preference or discrimination, regardless of religion, culture, or nationality. That includes those who are in our neighborhoods and those who are on the other side of the world. We have the responsibility to cross both streets and oceans with the gospel. God commissions us, as the church, to have a truly global impact.

And to wrap our heads around this one, we need to understand the nature of the church. The church is both universal and local. There is one overarching Biblical mission that directs the actions of all true churches across the world. We at Neartown are one local expression of this universal church. So if the universal church exists to bear witness to the coming kingdom and make disciples of all nations, then the local church exists as a specific outpost for that global effort. The local church serves the mission of the whole. While we as one local church cannot reach our entire city, much less the world, by ourselves, the Great Commission gives us a vision for the mission both here and there. 

Unfortunately, many churches tend to lean in one direction or the other when it comes to their mission vision. Churches often tend to be either farsighted or nearsighted, and both of these visions are too small for global impact.

**Let’s start with the Farsighted Church: **The farsighted church gets international missions. They are always sending teams on short term trips, they have pictures of missionaries on the walls, and often invite missionaries to speak at their church. They collect large sums of money to send to their missions agency. Even domestic church plants are typically sent to large cities far away like Chicago or New York. To them, missions is synonymous with distance.

However, this church doesn't tend to spend a lot of time on training its members to be personal disciple-makers. They don't pay much attention to the neighborhood around them. Most of its members may not even live in that neighborhood. They may know the names of the missionaries they support, but not of the families that live next-door. 

**And there is the the Nearsighted Church: **The nearsighted church is often a reaction to the farsighted church. It focuses on local ministry and being present and active in its immediate neighborhood. It serves the local schools and neighborhood councils. Its members participate in area charities or the municipal government. The church emphasizes living out the gospel at work and in the community, where disciple making occurs. However, a **_hyper_**-focus on what is near makes it easy to lose sight of the mission’s global scope. A vision that only sees what is near is set too low. Members are taught to roll their sleeves up at home, but they do little to ensure the gospel goes anywhere else. The nearsighted church knows the names of their neighbors, but its members never think to pray for new churches overseas, for Christians persecuted in closed countries... and even if they did, they do not know any by name. If missions is confined to their neighborhood, they will never know the joy of training and sending missionaries to take the gospel to unreached nations. Nor do they ever have that confidence in the gospel that comes from seeing how rapidly it is spreading through the toughest places in the world. 

**Corrective Lenses: **Let me underscore this, both of these churches get something very right. On the one hand, the Great Commission is a global mission, and for the last 200 years, the modern missions movement has pushed churches past their own community. Without an eye on the nations, the gospel would not have spread at all. The early church was keen on international missions and making the gospel known where it was not. Paul said that was his chief ambition. Fact is, you and I are Christians today because a Jew 2000years ago decided to leave his local church and become an international missionary. But, all missions technically happens in the local. It may not be your local, but it is local for someone. Churches that do not have an eye on the community where they are planted are perhaps missing the big E on the eye-chart. Both the farsighted and the nearsighted church get one aspect of this correct, and we need to celebrate that. But focusing on one of these to the exclusion of the other means the opportunity for global impact is lost. 

If farsighted churches want to have a global impact, they must remember they have an actual location. They are situated in a real place, with a real group of members with real jobs and real homes in real neighborhoods. Working together with other churches to make disciples in the neighborhoods of their city should be the foundational posture of any local church.

For nearsighted churches to have a global impact, they need to speak of the nations more. While they may be very involved at home, these churches often forget they are part of something bigger. These churches often invest little in international missions. There is no focus on calling members to overseas work, and they can have a whole missions legacy that has made no disciples outside of their own community. They need to challenge members with the reality that God sends us places, and that he may want to send them. Then, they need to put their money and human resources where their mouth is. Something neat begins to happen in a nearsighted church when it starts seeing that there is a bigger world out there in need of the gospel. Members are challenged by the Great Commission in an all new way.

A truly global understanding of the Great Commission is neither nearsighted nor farsighted, but realizes that the church is meant to impact the whole world. And that is how a church has global impact. 


### This mission is about “All the Commands”
Of course, making disciples is about more than people raising hands and walking aisles. Growing in godliness is a lifelong process. Making disciples means walking people from unbelief, across the line of faith, and all the way to maturity in Christ. This means we continue to teach and we do it in community.

**Baptizing and teaching is the job of the local church:** This type of continued teaching comes from the local church setting. We must realize that Jesus is speaking to his newly formed church about how to instruct those they reach. The Great Commission cannot be fulfilled as Jesus commanded apart from the local church.

This means we need more churches. A big part of the Great Commission is starting new churches. We need churches in places where there are none, like places in the Middle East and Asia, and we need more churches in places that already have them. And it also means your personal discipleship should be taking place in and through your local church and your Great Commission ministry flows out of the church. 

And by personal discipleship, I don’t simply mean coming on Sunday morning and spectating a sermon… it’s life-consuming after all. 

**It says teaching them to _obey_ the commands:** We love to miss this part nowadays. So much of what we call discipleship is just about filling our heads with things. It’s about book studies or small group time. It’s about podcasts and sermons, but if we’re not actually obeying these commands of Christ, can we really be calling ourselves disciples? And mind you, this command here to go and make new disciples is, in fact, one of Jesus’ commands that disciples must obey.

Discipleship is obedience-based. The very word disciple means to follow someone. Following is an active task. It is taking the same path that someone else took. It is doing the same things they did. Not simply knowing stuff about them. Being a disciple of Jesus means doing the things that Jesus did, not simply knowing that he did them. 


### Let’s recap the scope of this mission
So by this point, we need to stop and realize just how big this commission really is. Jesus has instructed his fledgling church to make new disciples everywhere in the world and teach them how to obey everything he’s ever commanded. Teach people everywhere in the world to obey everything he’s ever commanded. 

Y’all realize that’s a physically impossible mission right? 

Take the message of what I’ve just done here and spread it to everyone in the world, and don’t stop until no one is left out. Oh, and this discipleship thing is going to be a lifelong process for everyone that steps on the path, just so you know.

Now we’ve all had a ridiculous sales goal handed to us in a meeting at work. Or think back to the hardest class you had in college, when the professor slid that syllabus across the desk, and you looked at it and thought, “She expects me to do what this semester?!”

How do we know this global mission will be accomplished? It sounds like a fool’s errand. But we know, because of this final promise that Jesus makes next.


### Jesus will be with us for “All the Age”
His presence will be with the church until the end of the age. In other words, they are granted his actual authority to continue his mission and promised his presence as they do it. What more hope could we ask for?

There is still work to be done. We must work to the end of the age, but we do not do this work alone. The mission of the church is really the continuation of the work Christ has accomplished. He defeated death, so that we could have everlasting life. And he’s asked us to carry that news in his authority to all nations and teach them to obey all he’s commanded. Folks, this commission is not a burden… it’s an opportunity. It’s an opportunity to walk with Jesus as he builds his kingdom.

You know what happens at the end of the age? 

Thankfully, the Apostle John records for us what happens in the end. Jesus reveals the end of all time to John. He actually gets to see what happens when the mission is over, and this is what he sees:

    “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” <sup><strong> </strong></sup>And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.” Revelation 7:9-12

That is global impact. It is the commission and promise fulfilled. We know the church succeeds in this mission, and we see that Christ has been faithful to his promise. 

That is not a burden. We’ve been given a gift… the chance to participate in the biggest thing that has ever happened or will ever happen, the chance to reign with Christ for eternity. But we must work until this day, because there are so many people out there that do not know it is coming.

## Application Questions:

1. **We must be consumed by this all-encompassing mission.** Our values are what define us and determine what we do with our time and resources. We can say global impact is a value, but until it defines our lives, we are merely paying the idea lip service. On a personal level, do you make decisions about how you will spend your time and resources based on your ability to make new disciples?  
2. **We must avoid the temptation to be nearsighted or farsighted. **We can only truly have global impact if we understand the mission is near and far. If we are balancing our understanding of local ministry and strategic global outreach. As a church, we must answer the questions (1) How are we making new disciples near? And (2) How are we making new disciples far? Are we holding each other accountable in our personal disciple-making here? Do we have specific connections to the work of the global church? Are we challenging ourselves to go over there? Short term? Even long term as missionaries? 
3. **Finally, if you’re here today and wouldn’t call yourself a Christian,** I know this sermon was really geared toward believers. Think of it as a family discussion for us. But, I hope you leave here with a snapshot of God’s character. That he loves humanity so much that he has enacted a plan to reach out with restoration and healing without discrimination, that it is available for everyone, and that he holds his church responsible for getting that message to every corner of the globe. He cares that much. 

**_Jesus calls, equips, empowers and sends his Church on an all-encompassing mission with a global impact, for the good of the nations and the demonstration of his glory._**
