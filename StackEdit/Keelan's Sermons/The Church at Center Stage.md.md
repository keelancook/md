## Introduction

 I love a good underdog story.

 I always like rooting for the underdog. It doesn't really matter what sport it is, but there's just something about watching a team succeed that has no real chance of doing so. Great underdog upsets are the kind of sporting events that get turned into feel-good movies later on.

 Today, we're going to talk about an underdog story.

 In Ephesians chapter 3, Paul outlines what may be the greatest underdog story in all of history. And it is especially important for you and me, because if we look closely, we will find ourselves in the story and see that God has a message for us 2000 years after Paul first wrote these words to the church in the city of Ephesus.

 The Word of the Lord starting in Ephesians 3 vs 7 says this:

## (Read Ephesians 3:7-12.)
> *Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power.*

> *8 To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 and [i](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Eph3.2)to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,*

> *10 so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.*

> *11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.*

## Two quick things I want us to catch from the beginning:

 First: **Paul had a calling.** He was made a minister. It was a specific calling, he didn't decide what he was going to do, he was given his task by Christ.  

 Second: **The gospel is a mystery.** Paul refers to this gospel as a mystery.

 Now, it wasn't a mystery because it was confusing. It was a mystery because it was once hidden, but has now been revealed. This becomes a central point in Paul's explanation moving forward.

After telling the Ephesian church members that he was made a minister of this gospel, Paul continues by explaining to them what his ministry looks like. What   it is God has tasked him to do. And this is where I really want us to focus our attention today. What does this ministry look like?  

Paul outlines that ministry in **two specific tasks and one very important outcome**.

## First, let’s look at the tasks.

 **We find the first task in verse 8:** *to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8)*

 Of course we need to realize here that preaching does not primarily mean what I am doing right now. We can include what I am doing, but the word used in this passage is broader than that. It really means to speak the gospel to people. That could happen like this, but more often in the New Testament, we see preaching referring to conversations in small groups of people or between two individuals. So Paul is really talking about speaking the gospel to people who have not heard it, and that may have been one on one, in small groups, or in a more formal setting like a church service.

 And the other word I want us to make sure we understand is Gentiles. The word Gentiles is used in the Bible to mean people who are not Jews. But, I want us to really understand that. The Greek term that is used here is the same one we translate as nations in other passages, like The Great Commission in Matthew, where it says go and make disciples of all nations.

If we read this passage that way, we realize that the gospel is for all nations, no one is excluded, and that it is our responsibility to share the gospel with everyone, no matter where they are from, what they look like, or what they currently believe.

Now that has some real application for a church like yours in a neighborhood that's if changing like this one. That the gospel is a message for everyone means you have a responsibility to all of your new neighbors, no matter what they look like, or what they currently believe about stuff. It's your job to find them and tell them, even if you think they don't want to hear it.

The first task is *to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8)*

 **The second task follows in verse 9:** *to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God (Eph. 3:9)*

### God has had a plan from the very beginning.

 From cover to cover the Bible tells us about God's plan, about this mystery as Paul calls it, about his multi-faceted or manifold wisdom.

God made everything right and pure, and then man sins in the garden, and sin entered the world. But right after the fall, we see that God promises a way to fix the mess. He promises that a seed of the woman would one day crush the head of the serpent. That's the very first proclamation of the gospel in the Bible. It's all the way up there in the beginning.

And then, only a few chapters later, God promises Abraham that through his lineage all the world will one day be blessed.

Many years later, King David is told that he will one day have a son that will sit on his throne and rule for all eternity.  

The prophets in the Old Testament speak of his coming, the one who would bless all nations, the one who would sit on the throne of David forever.

And in the gospels, we meet him.  

Jesus is the one who crushes the head of the serpent, he is the one from the line of Abraham that will bless all nations, and he is the heir to the throne of David and, let me tell you, kingdom will have no end.

By his death, by his sacrifice, we are healed. That evil that stained the world all they way back at the beginning of the story in the garden of Eden can be erased by the blood of the Lamb. And not just for the Jews, but for all the nations of the world.  

That is the multi-faceted wisdom of God. That is the mystery hidden for ages and now revealed because of Jesus.

 So Paul outlines for us these two central tasks of the mission:
- to preach the gospel to those who've not yet heard or accepted and
- to shed light on how God's plan will unfold, and Paul accomplishes this last one by starting churches all over the Mediterranean.

### If those were the tasks, let’s look at the outcome.
 Why did God have Paul, and by the extension the rest of the church, doing these things?

He tells us right there in verse 10: *so that… the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known (Eph. 3:10)*

Known to whom? Again, he tells us: to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.

Paul has already said that his work is proclaiming and revealing this mystery to all nations, all people. Now, Paul goes further with the astonishing statement that it is so that God's manifold wisdom may now be made known to the hosts of heaven as well.  

 The mystery of God is to be revealed to all of creation. Everyone on the earth and everyone above the earth.  

## (The Agent of God's Plan: The Church)
But perhaps the most outstanding part of all of this is how God accomplishes revealing this plan.

Paul tells us, right here in the text. The agent of God's plan – **is the church.**

As Paul and others preach to the gentiles, to the nations, they begin to form churches. These churches then become the engines of gospel proclamation, the revealers of the mystery. The members of these little churches begin speaking the gospel to their family and friends, to their coworkers and neighbors.

And those churches are the center of God's plan to reveal his manifold wisdom to those on earth and those above the earth.

## (The Divine Drama:)
Think of it like this: God is writing a story throughout all of history. It is a grand drama from the beginning to the end, that will ultimately reveal his great glory as creator and sovereign Lord over all that he has made.

All of the universe is a giant stage, and right there in the center of the stage is the church. The church lives out God's great plan. After Christ's resurrection and ascension, now the church takes center stage and becomes the main actor in the grand drama.

Let's be clear. That doesn't mean that we are the ones who make this drama happen, and it doesn't mean we are the ones with the power to remove sin and fix the world. It does mean that we are the ones at center stage through which God will reveal his manifold wisdom.  

**It is not the powerful governments of this world**, with their rulers making decisions that shape the course of nations. That's not who this verse singles out. Governments are not center stage in history.

**It is not the great businesses of the world** that generate the world's wealth. Corporations are not center stage.

 **It is not the scientific discoveries** happening at the world's best universities.  

 **It is not even the angels or spiritual beings** who will reveal to all the universe God's manifold wisdom. Paul says they are sitting in the audience watching the drama take place.

 Who is center stage? It is the church. The simple, ordinary church.  

In this passage, Paul lets us in on the mystery. That same mystery that was hidden for the ages is now clear, and what a startling surprise. God's great plan for the cosmos unfolds in little gatherings of believers just like this one all over the world.  

## (Three important truths about the church:)
 A biblical scholar named John Stott notes that there are three important truths about the church in this passage.

 ### Truth 1: The church is central to history.

Here's something for you to chew on for a while. Among all the human institutions of the world... only the church survives history. When the old earth passes away and the kingdom of God is finally and fully consummated in a new heavens and new earth, the Bible tells us it is the church, not any government or corporation, not any social or political ideology that will one day rule alongside Christ in the new kingdom.

So the church is central to history.

### Truth 2: The church is central to the gospel.

 The church is both 
 1. created by the gospel
 2. the way others find out about the gospel.
 
It is created by the gospel, because we are not just saved out of something, we are saved into something. If we rightly understand the gospel, then we realize it saves us out of sin, but that it also saves us into Christ's body. There is no biblical category for a Christian who is not an active part of a local church. Today, we've gotten comfortable with that category, but there are no examples in the New Testament of Christians, people made into new creations by the power of the gospel, who exist apart from a local assembly of believers. So, the church is created by the gospel.

The church's mission is to proclaim the gospel. Christ was very clear that the mission of the church, and that means the mission of those who belong to the church. And while we're at it, don't speak about your church with "they." They aren't focusing on the right stuff, or they should do fill in the blank. If you belong to a church, use "we." That's the right word. We aren't focusing on the right stuff, and we should do fill in the blank. A church is no more than a collection of individuals who make it up. It is that group of individuals who are supposed to do the work of the church.

Now, where was i... Christ was very clear that the mission of the church, is to speak the gospel and make disciples of all nations.

*That means we all have a very very important task.*

The church itself is not the good news, but it is a result of the good news. The church cannot save the world or fix society. Christ saves the world, and he will one day return to transform the world into a perfect kingdom. No, it's not the church that saves the world, but it is our job to let everyone know who does.

We are the ones that Christ has trusted to continue sharing the message of salvation with anyone who will listen. We share it with our mouths.

But, we also demonstrate it in how we join together in community as a local church. The church and the way we live together now and how we treat those outside of the church should be a little preview of the kingdom that is to come.

So, the church is central to the gospel.

### Truth 3: The church is central to Christian living.

The church is necessary to live the Christian life well.

Let me repeat it: There is no biblical category for a Christian that is not part of a local church.

Kent Hughes, another biblical scholar, says it this way: *You don't have to go to church to be a Christian just like you don't have to go home to be married. (Kent Hughes)*

Christian, I cannot stress enough how important the local church is to your life. You need each other.

**Your church is essential for your holiness.** We teach one another. Not just from the pulpit, but with our lives as we live together. Church members, the way you treat each other should teach each other and people outside the church about the gospel.

**Your church is essential for your joy.** When we love one another as the church should, we bear one another's burdens. And this produces the joy of the Christian life.

You may have a lot of friends or a big family, but no other group of people can supply for the Christian the joy that comes from real biblical community.

**Your church is essential for your purpose and ministry.** Just as Paul had a specific ministry, given to him by God. So do we. If you have crossed the line into faith, then you have been grafted into God's church and you have been enlisted into God's mission. No exceptions.  

 The only way to truly participate in the mission of the church is to do so through the ministry of your local church.   

## (God's plan all along)
 That the church would be this important, this central to the world was God's plan all along.

 Verse 11 tells us: "This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Eph 3:11)

 This sounds like an overwhelming responsibility? How can a regular, ordinary church congregation be expected to do this?  

 Paul goes on in verse 12 to tell us: "In him we have boldness and confident access through faith in him." (Eph 3:12)  

 We can step into this important role as the church confidently, because we have access to God himself through Christ Jesus our Lord.  

## (Word of Encouragement for Lazybrook)
 The reason I wanted us to look at this chapter today was so that I could encourage you. This passage shows us why what happens with your church matters so much. Being a committed member of a local congregation matters more than you can ever understand. Because of your church the heavenly hosts get to watch the very plan of God unfold.

 Perhaps you’re a Christ follower, and you’re listening to this and can’t say you have a church family. If that’s you, then I want to challenge you to find one. I'm sure the folk here at Lazybrook would be more than happy for you to join in, but if not here, find a church home. You need it. We all do.

 Maybe you’ve not yet crossed that line of faith. If that’s you, know that God has a plan. He’s had a plan from the very beginning, and at the very center of that plan is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Christ heals the brokenness in us, and he will one day return to put an end to all of the brokenness in the world. He promises a new life of peace and joy lived in *real community with others, and that’s found in a church*.

 Finally, let me speak directly to those of you who already call Lazybrook your church home. Let me get frank with you for moment. It would be easy right now to distance yourself from your church. You all have had a lot to deal with in the last year. COVID has made things real hard. It would be easy to pull away because of that.

 You guys have entered into a period of looking hard at what your doing, this discovery process, that's hard stuff. If you're on that discovery team, you're asking some big questions right now, questions about the future of the church. If you're not on that team, you're probably wondering what in the world they're even doing, right? There's all kinds of uncertainty at a time like this in the life of a church. It would be tempting to pull away.

 And, as you guys finish up this discovery phase, you're going to have some results. And as a church, you will probably have to make some really hard decisions. You may discover that you need to sacrifice some of your own preferences if you want your church to actually be a part of that mission we just discusses, all that stuff that God has established the church to do. Making sacrifices, making changes.... it would be tempting to pull away.

 You guys have a lot going on right now, and it would be tempting to disengage, to distance yourself from your church, to refuse to stick in there when changes start to happen so you can better reach your community.

 It'll be tempting, but it would be a mistake to do so. Now, more than ever, is a time to push in, especially when it seems like everything is conspiring to keep you apart. It's good and right for all of us to be cautious about how we're gathering right now. And it's good and right for you all, as a church, to be taking a hard look at yourselves, so you can better be on mission with Christ.

If you ever struggle to find purpose in what happens here. If you ever get tired of the effort of trying to love and serve one another. If you get tired of speaking the gospel to each other and to those outside of your group. And if you ever think that your church can't accomplish big things. Know that this ordinary church is the thing God has chosen to reveal his wisdom to the cosmos.

It is more valuable than you or I can comprehend. It is worth living for. It is worth working for.
